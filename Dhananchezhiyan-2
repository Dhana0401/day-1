 1. Write the key differences between browser js and nodejs
 Browser js Nodejs
* Javascript is a programming language      * Nodejs is a javascript runtime environment 
 that is used for writing scripts on                          
 website
*Javascript can only be run in websites             * We can run javascript outside 
 browsers with the help of Nodejs
 * It is basically used on client-side         * It is mostly used on server-side
 * We can add HTML and play with  DOM           * Nodejs doesn't have capability to add HTML tags
* Javascript is used in frontend         * Nodejs is used in serverside development
 development 
 
 2.FROM VIDEO 
 * PARSING HTML
 ^ HTML is forgiving by nature
 ^ Parsing isnâ€™t straight forward
 ^ Can be halted
 ^ Will do speculative halting 
 ^ Its re-Entrant
 * FORGIVING NATURE OF HTML
 - Even if our code is wrong, our code will run but output might change
 * PARSING ISNT STRAIGHT FORWARD
 - Parsing means analyzing and converting a program in internal format that runtime
environment can actually run
 - Network----Tokeniser 1 -----tree construction 2 ------ DOM. there is separate interaction 
between 1 and Script execution
 Script execution to 2
 * CAN BE HALTED
 - Will halt the parser as a script can alter the document
 -> Network latency
 -> link & style could halt js execution
 * Speculative Parsing
 - Will look ahead
 - External images,scripts,css
 * ITS RE-ENTRANT
 - At its simplest a re-entrant parser doesnt use global variables and thus can 
have multiple instances active at the same time


 3. Code execution
 1) type of (1) = number
 2) type of (1.1) = number
 3) type of ("1.1") = string
 4) type of (true) = boolean
 5) type of (null) = object
 6) type of(undefined) = undefined
 7) type of([]) = object
 8) type of({}) = object
 9) type of(NaN) = number
